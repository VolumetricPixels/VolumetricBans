![VP Bullet] What is VolumetricBans?
-----------------
VolumetricBans is a global banning system for Spout. It focuses on making the lives of admins everywhere easier. It can also be used 
by developers, as it is easy to extend, and has various events and lots of JavaDocs to make it easy to understand.

![VP Bullet] Features?
-----------------
VolumetricBans features include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Local bans
* Temporary bans
* Global bans
* Mutes (timed)
* Player lookups
* Events / API for developers

![VP Bullet] Progress
-----------------
The VolumetricBans plugin is largely finished, although we intend to add quite a few more features to it before full release. The plugin 
itself is pretty much at a beta phase. However, we cannot currently release the plugin even as a beta beause the website is currently 
unfinished. If you would like to join the team and help out with website / web API development and bugfixing and testing later 
on, get in contact with us!
